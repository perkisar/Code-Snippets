<!-- This snippet of code was used in the iFormBuilder app for ProTech Industries while I was at Vancouver Bolt and Supply. 
      Its purpose was to test the functionality and syntax of the .subtring and .split methods to separate characters from the 
      originial string. 
      
      In the application, a barcode scanner is used to populate the pt_item field with a part number like the one hard-coded below.
      The application then shaves off the '$' and any remaining characters off of the part number, and displays it in another input
      field. In another field, the characters following the '$' are saved in a variable and shown as a quantity. -->

    <p id="pt_item">COT826724$1.000</p>
    <p id="pt_itemparsed"></p>
    <p id="pt_quantity"></p>

    <script>
        var partnum = document.getElementById('pt_item').innerHTML;
        var parsedpartnum = document.getElementById('pt_itemparsed');
        var quantity = document.getElementById('pt_quantity');

        parsedpartnum.innerHTML = partnum.substring(0, partnum.indexOf('$'));
        quantity.innerHTML = partnum.split('$')[1];
    </script>
